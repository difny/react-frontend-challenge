## Frontend Test (React)

Your challenge - should you choose to accept it - is to
build a "state-of-the art" encryption tool! ;)

In the Form component, you will find an input and an
output element.

A person (let's call him a secret agent) can enter a message.

*Each word* in the message should be reversed and the resulting message shown in the output box.

Please implement the solution by using React Hooks.

#### Example

##### Input
```
This is a test - is this thing on?
```
##### Output
```
sihT si a tset - si siht gniht ?no
```
